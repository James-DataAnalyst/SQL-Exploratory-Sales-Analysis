# Exploratory Analysis for Sales Data using SQL

## Introduction
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of sales data using SQL. The primary objectives of this analysis are to identify the best-performing products, 
analyze monthly sales trends, segment customers, and evaluate top customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.
 By examining these aspects, we aim to derive actionable insights that can inform business strategies and decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comprises 2,823 sales records, capturing various attributes related to sales transactions. The columns in the dataset include:

- `ORDERNUMBER`: Unique identifier for the order
- `QUANTITYORDERED`: Number of items ordered
- `PRICEEACH`: Price per item
- `ORDERLINENUMBER`: Line number in the order
- `SALES`: Total sales value for the line item
- `ORDERDATE`: Date of the order
- `STATUS`: Order status (e.g., Shipped, Cancelled)
- `QTR_ID`: Quarter of the year
- `MONTH_ID`: Month of the year
- `YEAR_ID`: Year of the transaction
- `PRODUCTLINE`: Product line category
- `MSRP`: Manufacturer's suggested retail price
- `PRODUCTCODE`: Unique identifier for the product
- `CUSTOMERNAME`: Name of the customer
- `PHONE`: Customer's phone number
- `ADDRESSLINE1`: Customer's address (line 1)
- `ADDRESSLINE2`: Customer's address (line 2)
- `CITY`: Customer's city
- `STATE`: Customer's state
- `POSTALCODE`: Customer's postal code
- `COUNTRY`: Customer's country
- `TERRITORY`: Sales territory
- `CONTACTLASTNAME`: Contact person's last name
- `CONTACTFIRSTNAME`: Contact person's first name
- `DEALSIZE`: Size of the deal (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)

This dataset includes sales transactions from the years 2003, 2004, and 2005.


## Key Queries and Results
### 1. Best Month for Sales

-- This query finds the best month for sales in the year 2003, 2004 and 2005 by summing the sales for each month and ordering the result by total sales.
SELECT [MONTH_ID], SUM([SALES]) REVENUE, COUNT([ORDERNUMBER]) FREQUENCY
FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
WHERE [YEAR_ID] = 2003 --- Change date to see the rest
GROUP BY [MONTH_ID]
ORDER BY 2 DESC 


### 2. RFM Analysis for	CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
---Who is our best customer? (this will be best answered with RFM)
-- This query calculates Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer to perform RFM analysis.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #rfm 
;with rfm as
(
SELECT
   [CUSTOMERNAME],
   SUM([SALES]) MonetaryValue,
   AVG([SALES]) AvgMonetaryValue,
   COUNT([ORDERNUMBER]) Frequency,
   MAX([ORDERDATE]) Last_Order_Date,
   (SELECT  MAX ([ORDERDATE])  FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]) Max_Order_Date, 
  DATEDIFF (DD, MAX ([ORDERDATE]), (SELECT  MAX([ORDERDATE])  FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample])) Recency
   FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
   GROUP BY [CUSTOMERNAME]
   ),
   rfm_calc as
   (

   select r.*,
   NTILE (4) OVER (order by Recency desc) rfm_recency,
   NTILE (4) OVER (order by Frequency) rfm_frequency,
   NTILE (4) OVER (order by MonetaryValue) rfm_monetary   
   from rfm r

   )
   select c.*, rfm_recency+ rfm_frequency+ rfm_monetary as rfm_cell,
  cast (rfm_recency as varchar)+ cast (rfm_frequency as varchar) + cast (rfm_monetary as varchar) rfm_cell_string
  into #rfm
   from rfm_calc c

   select CUSTOMERNAME, rfm_recency, rfm_frequency, rfm_monetary,
case
   when rfm_cell_string in (111, 112, 121, 123, 132, 211, 212, 114, 141, 122) then 'lost_customers' ---lost customers
   when rfm_cell_string in (133, 134, 143, 244, 334, 343, 344, 144, 234) then 'slipping away, cannot lose' ---(Big spenders who haven't purchased lately) slipping away
   when rfm_cell_string in (311, 411, 331, 421) then 'new customers' 
   when rfm_cell_string in (222, 223, 233, 322, 232, 221) then 'potentail churners'
   when rfm_cell_string in (323, 333, 321, 422, 332, 432, 412) then 'active'  ---(Customers who buy often & recently, but at low price points) slipping away
   when rfm_cell_string in (433, 434, 443, 444, 423) then 'loyal'
end rfm_segment
   from #rfm;


### 3. Churn Prediction 

---This query detect Customers Who Stopped Ordering__confirming lost customers from rfm analysis
WITH RecentOrders AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, MAX(ORDERDATE) AS LastOrderDate
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME
),
OverallMaxDate AS (
    SELECT MAX(ORDERDATE) AS MaxOrderDate
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
)
SELECT ro.CUSTOMERNAME, ro.LastOrderDate
FROM RecentOrders ro
CROSS JOIN OverallMaxDate omd
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, ro.LastOrderDate, omd.MaxOrderDate) > 365
ORDER BY ro.LastOrderDate DESC;


### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis 

---This query calculate the total revenue generated by each customer over their lifetime with the company
---and ranked them in three value level (low, medium and high).
WITH CustomerRevenue AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, SUM(SALES) AS TotalSales
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME
),
CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERNUMBER) AS TotalOrders
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME
),
CustomerStats AS (
    SELECT c.CUSTOMERNAME, c.TotalSales, o.TotalOrders,
           (c.TotalSales / o.TotalOrders) AS AverageOrderValue
    FROM CustomerRevenue c
    JOIN CustomerOrders o
    ON c.CUSTOMERNAME = o.CUSTOMERNAME
),
RankedCustomers AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, TotalSales, TotalOrders, AverageOrderValue,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TotalSales DESC) AS SalesRank,
           CASE
               WHEN AverageOrderValue >= 50000 THEN 'High Value' -- Top 20%
               WHEN AverageOrderValue >= 25000 THEN 'Medium Value' -- Middle 60%
               ELSE 'Low Value' -- Bottom 20%
           END AS Remark
    FROM CustomerStats
)
SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, TotalSales, TotalOrders, AverageOrderValue, SalesRank, Remark
FROM RankedCustomers
ORDER BY SalesRank;


### 5. Customer Segmentation by Deal Size

---This query segment customers based on the size of the deals (Small, Medium, Large)
---We can use the following query to find out which customers frequently make large purchases.
WITH DealSizeCounts AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, DEALSIZE, COUNT(*) AS DealCount
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME, DEALSIZE
),
PivotedDealSizes AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMERNAME,
           ISNULL([Small], 0) AS SmallDealCount,
           ISNULL([Medium], 0) AS MediumDealCount,
           ISNULL([Large], 0) AS LargeDealCount
    FROM DealSizeCounts
    PIVOT (
        SUM(DealCount)
        FOR DEALSIZE IN ([Small], [Medium], [Large])
    ) AS PivotTable
)
SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, SmallDealCount, MediumDealCount, LargeDealCount
FROM PivotedDealSizes
ORDER BY SmallDealCount DESC, MediumDealCount DESC, LargeDealCount DESC;


### 6. Products Most Often Sold Together

---What products are most often sold together?
---This query identifies products that are often sold together by using a subquery to find orders with exactly two items.

---select * from [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample] where ORDERNUMBER = 10411
select distinct ORDERNUMBER, stuff (

   (select ','+ PRODUCTCODE
   from [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample] P
   where ORDERNUMBER in
   (
   select ORDERNUMBER
   from (

   select ORDERNUMBER, count (*) rn
   from [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
   where STATUS =  'Shipped'
   group by ORDERNUMBER
   ) m
   where rn =2 
   and p.ORDERNUMBER = s.ORDERNUMBER
   )
   for xml path (''))
   , 1, 1, '') PRODUCTCODES
   from [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample] s
   order by 2 desc;
   

### 7. Product Sales Trend Over Time

---This query examines sales trends over months, rank and filters the top 3 selling products per month 
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT YEAR_ID, MONTH_ID, PRODUCTCODE, SUM(SALES) AS TotalSales
    FROM [dbo].[WRK_sales_data_sample]
    GROUP BY YEAR_ID, MONTH_ID, PRODUCTCODE
),
RankedSales AS (
    SELECT YEAR_ID, MONTH_ID, PRODUCTCODE, TotalSales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY YEAR_ID ORDER BY TotalSales DESC) AS MonthlyRank
    FROM MonthlySales
)
SELECT YEAR_ID, MONTH_ID, PRODUCTCODE, TotalSales
FROM RankedSales
WHERE MonthlyRank <= 3
ORDER BY YEAR_ID, MONTH_ID, TotalSales DESC;

## How to Run
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

   - Create a database schema that matches the structure of the dataset. The SQL script for creating the tables is available in the `schema.sql` file.

2. Sample Data: 
   - Load the dataset into your database. You can find the sample data in the `sales_data.csv` file.

3. SQL Queries: 
   - Execute the provided SQL queries in the `queries.sql` file to perform the exploratory analysis. These queries cover aspects such as:
     - Identifying best-performing products
     - Analyzing monthly sales trends
     - Segmenting customers based on RFM metrics
     - Evaluating top customers
	 - Customer dealsize Segmentation
	 - Analyzing monthly product sales trend
	 - Identifying products sold Together
